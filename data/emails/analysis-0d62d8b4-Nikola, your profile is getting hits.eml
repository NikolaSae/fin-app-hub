Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain the data you are looking for. However, I can extract data from the rest of the email conversation if you provide it.

If you provide the rest of the conversation, I can help you extract the data in JSON format. 

Please provide the rest of the conversation.

That being said, here is a sample JSON format that I can use to extract the data:

```json
{
  "service_name": "",
  "start_date": "",
  "end_date": "",
  "price": "",
  "phone_number": "",
  "request_from_subject": "",
  "sender": "",
  "total_price": ""
}
```

Please provide the rest of the conversation. I will fill in the JSON format with the actual data. 

For example if you provide 

"Subject: Request for Web Development Service from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-31 
Sender: John Doe 
Price: $100 
Phone Number: 123-456-7890"

I can extract 

```json
{
  "service_name": "Web Development",
  "start_date": "2024-01-01",
  "end_date": "2024-01-31",
  "price": "$100",
  "phone_number": "123-456-7890",
  "request_from_subject": "Request for Web Development Service",
  "sender": "John Doe",
  "total_price": "$100"
}
```
There is no structured data in the provided email conversation. The text appears to be the email headers and HTML code, but it does not contain any relevant information about a service, dates, price, phone number, or other data that can be extracted.

However, if you provide the actual content of the email conversation, I can try to extract the structured data in JSON format for you. Please provide the content of the email.

If you provide a sample email like:

Subject: Request for Service
From: John Doe
To: Jane Doe
Content: I would like to request your Web Development service, which starts on 2022-01-01 and ends on 2022-01-31. The price is $1000. You can reach me at 123-456-7890.

I can extract data like:

```json
{
  "service_name": "Web Development",
  "start_date": "2022-01-01",
  "end_date": "2022-01-31",
  "price": "$1000",
  "phone_number": "123-456-7890",
  "request_from_subject": "Request for Service",
  "sender": "John Doe",
  "total_price": "$1000"
}
```
Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any meaningful information that can be extracted into a JSON object. The text appears to be a jumbled collection of special characters, numbers, and symbols that do not form any coherent message.

If you can provide the actual content of the email conversation, I would be happy to help you extract the structured data in JSON format. Please provide the relevant text, and I will do my best to assist you.

If you have a sample of what the data should look like (e.g., a sample email conversation), I can also help you create a JSON schema to define the structure of the data. 

For example, the JSON output might look something like this:

```json
{
  "service_name": "",
  "start_date": "",
  "end_date": "",
  "price": "",
  "phone_number": "",
  "request_from_subject": "",
  "sender": "",
  "total_price": ""
}
```

Please provide more context or information, and I will help you create a more accurate JSON output.
Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any relevant information about a service, dates, price, phone number, or a specific request. It appears to be a promotional email from LinkedIn.

However, if you'd like, I can try to extract some information, but it will be limited. Here is what I was able to find in JSON format:

```json
{
  "service_name": "LinkedIn Premium",
  "request_from_subject": null,
  "sender": "LinkedIn",
  "total_price": null,
  "start_date": null,
  "end_date": null,
  "price": null,
  "phone_number": null
}
```

If you provide a different part of the email conversation with actual relevant information, I'd be happy to help you extract it in JSON format.
Unfortunately, there is no structured data to extract from the provided part of the email conversation.

If you provide the actual content of the email conversation, I'd be happy to help you extract the structured data in JSON format. 

However, based on the provided text, here is an empty JSON object:

```json
{}
```
