Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain the data you are looking for. However, I can extract data from an example email conversation. Let's assume an example conversation:

From: John Doe [john.doe@example.com](mailto:john.doe@example.com)
To: Jane Doe [jane.doe@example.com](mailto:jane.doe@example.com)
Subject: Request for Service

Dear Jane,

I am writing to request your services for my upcoming event. The details are as follows:

* Service Name: Catering
* Start Date: 2024-03-20
* End Date: 2024-03-22
* Price: $1000

Please let me know if you are available. You can reach me at 123-456-7890.

Best regards,
John Doe

Here is the JSON data:

```json
{
  "service_name": "Catering",
  "start_date": "2024-03-20",
  "end_date": "2024-03-22",
  "price": "$1000",
  "phone_number": "123-456-7890",
  "request_from_subject": "Request for Service",
  "sender": "John Doe",
  "total_price": "$1000"
}
```

If you provide the actual email conversation, I can help you extract the data. 

Also, note that there was no total price different from price in your example, if you need help with something else just let me know.
There is no structured data in the provided email conversation that can be extracted in JSON format. The text appears to be a raw email header and HTML code, but it does not contain any specific information about a service, dates, price, phone number, or other requested data.

If you provide a different part of the email conversation that contains the actual message or content, I can try to extract the structured data in JSON format for you. 

Please provide more context or information about what you're looking for. 

For example you can give me the body of the email. 

Here is an example of what the JSON output might look like:

```json
{
  "service_name": "",
  "start_date": "",
  "end_date": "",
  "price": "",
  "phone_number": "",
  "request_from_subject": "",
  "sender": "",
  "total_price": ""
}
```
Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any meaningful information that can be extracted in JSON format. The text appears to be a jumbled collection of special characters, numbers, and symbols that do not form coherent data.

If you can provide the actual content of the email conversation, I would be happy to help extract the structured data in JSON format. Please provide the relevant information, and I will assist you in extracting the following:

* Service name
* Start date
* End date
* Price
* Phone number
* Request from subject
* Sender
* Total price

in JSON format.
Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain the information you're looking for. It appears to be a promotional email from LinkedIn, not a service request or order.

However, if you provide the actual email conversation related to a service request, I'll be happy to help extract the structured data in JSON format:

* service name
* start date
* end date
* price
* phone number
* request from subject
* sender
* total price

Please provide the relevant email conversation.
Unfortunately, there is no structured data to extract from the provided part of the email conversation. The text appears to be a footer and header from a LinkedIn email, and does not contain any relevant information about a service, dates, price, phone number, or any other data that could be extracted in JSON format.

If you provide the actual content of the email conversation, I would be happy to help you extract the structured data in JSON format. 

However, based on your request, I can give you an example of what the JSON format might look like:

```
{
  "service_name": "",
  "start_date": "",
  "end_date": "",
  "price": "",
  "phone_number": "",
  "request_from_subject": "",
  "sender": "",
  "total_price": ""
}
```
It seems like there's no actual email conversation provided. However, I can guide you on how to extract structured data from an email conversation in JSON format if you provide the conversation.

Once you provide the conversation, I can help extract data in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "service_name": "",
  "start_date": "",
  "end_date": "",
  "price": "",
  "phone_number": "",
  "request_from_subject": "",
  "sender": "",
  "total_price": ""
}
```

Please provide the email conversation. I'll be happy to assist you.
